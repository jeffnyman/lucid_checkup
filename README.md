# Lucid Checkup

Lucid Checkup provides solutions for checking out BDD-style test repositories for anti-patterns in terms of test expression.

## Installation

To get the latest stable release, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lucid_checkup'
```

To get the latest code:

```ruby
gem 'lucid_checkup', git: 'https://github.com/jeffnyman/lucid_checkup'
```

After doing one of the above, execute the following command:

    $ bundle

You can also install Lucid Checkup just as you would any other gem:

    $ gem install lucid_checkup

## Usage

Usage instructions will be coming soon.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec:all` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

The default `rake` command will run all tests as well as a RuboCop analysis.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
